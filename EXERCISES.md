## [max_serial] Find the maximum element

Difficulty: 1 out of 5

Given an array of elements, find the maximum element in there.

## [ubst] Unbalanced Binary Search Tree

Difficulty: 2 out of 5

Create a data structure to hold an unbalanced binary search tree (UBST). Simplification: only make the data structure hold `int`s

More information:

  * [binary tree at wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)

### Extra 1: Hold any type

Difficulty: 3 out of 5

Expand the session to hold any data type, so the UBST can hold any type inside (e.g., long, bool, struct).

## [ubst_search] Searching in an Unbalanced Binary Search Tree

Prerequisites: ubst

Difficulty: 2 out of 5

Given an UBST, find whether the element given is in the tree. This should be done in an efficient way (cost: `O(log n)`)

Signature: `bool bst_contains(ubst* ubst, int needle);`
