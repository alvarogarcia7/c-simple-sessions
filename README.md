# C Simple Sessions

Each folder represents a programming session in C.

## Starting a new session

Note: there are multiple skeleton folders: they start with `skeleton.*`. E.g., `skeleton`, `skeleton_cmake`.

To start a new session with the `skeleton` folder, duplicate the folder:

```
cp -R skeleton new_session
cd new_session
make test
```

(Optionally, you can replace `new_session` with a provided name).

## Available sessions

Each folder is a started session (might be complete or not). Therefore, to review the available sessions, see which folders are present.

## Pending sessions
