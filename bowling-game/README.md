# Bowling game

## Description

Practice the Kata of the Bowling game, in a mob-programming session.

Tests are written with [CMocka](https://cmocka.org/).

The session could be incomplete, as we'll develop it further.

## Library dependency

This session depends on CMocka. It needs to be included.

You can achieve this by running CMake.

Either manually, or using CLion.

Manually:

```bash
make install-dependencies
```

CLion:

* Open the project, import the CMake configuration

Checking the installation:

* You should see a folder `_deps` inside your cmake build folder
* If you run the tests (either manually or from CLion), 4 tests should pass.
